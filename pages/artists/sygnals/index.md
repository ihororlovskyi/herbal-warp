Signal: an electrical impulse or radio wave transmitted or received.
Converted to "Sygnals" because of the transmission through multiple brains ! 
A collaboration of Alexandros A.(R.I.P), Aristides K. and Phoebus N.
Each one of them started producing music at the early 2000. Being friends for many years & having the need to create something unique they decided to join forces. Tuning their different acoustic influences, combining music knowledge, creativity & fantasy, they formed Sygnals in 2007.

Their sole purpose is to produce cerebral music for inner & outer mind-journeys, throughout a fusion of chill-out, downbeat & atmospheric psychedelic soundscapes..!
Stay Tuned !!
