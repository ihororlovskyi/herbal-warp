AstroPilot is psychill/psybient alliase of Russian/Ukranian composer Dmitriy Redko. The project was started with ethno-chill/psydub sound on debut album "Fruits Of The Imagination" and releases on various compilations.

But later after years AstroPilot music transformed to more spacy and progressive. And now style of the project could divided on 2 main parts: space ambient and progressive chillout/psybient.
