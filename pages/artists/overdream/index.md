Back in 2006 Makus and Dana started Overdream as a dark psy project, but during the years it became much more than that. Right after their initial release on Avatar Records (Israel) in 2006 Overdream started performing their music as an electronic duo and with dj sets. 

Till now, Overdream appeared on more than 50 releases. Besides Overdream, Makus successfully runs and participates in other musical projects, such as psy-progressive solo act Algae Bloom, avant-garde band Lunatic Cafe and others.
