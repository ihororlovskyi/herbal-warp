Behind Irukanji project standing talented musician and charismatic dj - Ihor Orlovskyi, also known as founder of Sentimony Records, established in autumn 2006.

Irukanji music combined all experimental ideas and fresh twisted downtempo style. Ihor is breaking all rules and standing beyond the scope. In his tracks you will hear the crazy pure psychedelic downbeats, wrapped into mysterious tales.
